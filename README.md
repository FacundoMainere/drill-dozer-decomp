# Drill Dozer decomp pool

A matching decompilation of Drill Dozer (USA, GBA, SHA1 `c1058cc2482b91204100cc8515da99aeb06773f5`)
that anyone invited can contribute to, by hand or by pointing their own AI agent at the repository. Contributors need no write access: they claim
functions, solve them and release them through pull requests that GitHub Actions validates
and merges automatically. Nobody spends tokens or time reviewing routine contributions.

## How it works

- `functions.csv` lists every function to decompile with its size and the SHA1 of its
  original bytes. The repository never contains the ROM.
- A claim is a file `pool/claims/ADDR` holding the claimer and a timestamp. One file per
  record means concurrent PRs never conflict.
- A solved function is `src/func_ADDR.c`. CI compiles it with agbcc, refuses inline asm,
  data, comments and stray directives, links it at its address and compares the SHA1.
- Claims expire after `claim_hours`; each expired claim is a strike, and too many strikes
  stop a user from claiming. All limits are in `pool.toml`.
